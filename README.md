Marlon Balandra's Code &amp; Script Libraries
This Repository is being written by me and will be a collection of my DEV-OPS toolbox. I have been in the SYSTEMS side of IT for over 14 years professional and over 37 years as a hobby.
My goal is to write scripts to automate everything that can be automated. I am writing all my scripts mostly in BASH & korn for now. I will eventually start uploading Python & Ruby scripts, as I come across needs and wants.  

QUICK VIEW OF THE ROAD MAP & FUTURE OF THIS REPO:

- OS BUILD AUTOMATION SCRIPTS for LINUX/UNIX OS Automation Scripts (eventually add it to the SYSDASHBOARD)
    - rapid deploy LINUX vm's
    - automate custom system configs 
    - install desired apps for rapid vm builds
    - MORE COMING
  



- DAILY TASKS for LINUX/UNIX OS Automation Scripts
    - SYSDASHBOARD.sh will be a menu driven automation dashboard, built in BASH to manage an Administrators system environment 
      - set_path.sh (completed)
      - userdel script+weekly+cron script/built in menu
      - useradd+createhomeDIR+genrandompwd script (started)
      - disk space monitoring DISKS/FS/PART
    
  LOTS MORE COMING !!!
